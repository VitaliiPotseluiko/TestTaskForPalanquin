# String Sorter
     * The StringSorter class defines the contract for sorting strings based on
     * alphabetical order while skipping words that start with a specific prefix.
     *
     * Example:
     *  Input: ["apple", "banana", "grape", "avocado", "cherry"], Exception prefix: "a"
     *  Output: ["banana", "cherry", "grape", "avocado", "apple"]
     *
     *  Here, "banana", "cherry", and "grape" are sorted in alphabetical order
     *  whereas "avocado" and "apple" (that start with 'a') are sorted in reverse alphabetical order
     *  at the end of the list.
